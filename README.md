# Bachelor's thesis

This repository contains my Bachelor's thesis at the University of Helsinki.
The topic of this thesis is the application of fuzzy hashing algorithms in digital forensics, such as malware detection.
I provide an in-depth discussion on three fuzzy hashes: ssdeep (sic), sdhash (sic), and mvHash-B. In addition, I review their capabilities
and shortcomings in the field of static malware analysis.
